# Quadratic-Assignment-Problem
In this repo I pretend presenting ten different heuristic C++ implementations for solving classic QAP.
Modular adaptation is an essential point to achieve, so Random.hh, QClass.hh and InputOutput.hh must be included in all ten algorithms to work and to be equipared adequatedely in computational measuring tasks.
Enjoy it!
